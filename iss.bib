  abstract = {A key step in program optimization is the determination of optimal
	values for code optimization parameters such as cache tile sizes
	and loop unrolling factors. One approach, which is implemented in
	most compilers, is to use analytical models to determine these values.
	The other approach, used in library generators like ATLAS, is to
	perform a global search over the space of parameter values by generating
	different versions of the code and executing them on the actual machine
	to find the parameter values that give the best performance. Neither
	approach is suitable for use in general-purpose compilers that must
	generate high quality code for large programs running on complex
	architectures. Model-driven optimization may incur a performance
	penalty of 10-20\% even for a relatively simple code like matrix
	multiplication, as was shown recently by Yotov et al. On the other
	hand, global search is not tractable for optimizing large programs
	for complex architectures because the optimization space is too large.
	To address this problem, some researchers are exploring more sophisticated
	search algorithms such as the simplex method, but it remains to be
	seen if these methods are successful in reducing search time without
	compromising on the quality of the solution. In this paper, we advocate
	a different methodology for generating high-performance code without
	increasing search time dramatically. Our methodology has three components:
	(i) modeling, (ii) local search, and (iii) model refinement. We use
	analytical models to estimate optimal values for transformation parameters.
	Since it is impossible to build tractable analytical models that
	capture all the features of complex architectures, we advocate improving
	these estimates by using a local search in the neighborhood of the
	model-predicted values. Finally, if the performance gap between handwritten
	code and generated code is substantial on some architecture, we advocate
	model refinement. To demonstrate this methodology, we built a modified
	ATLAS system that used a simple analytical model and local search,
	and showed that on most architectures, the performance of the code
	produced by this system was comparable to that of code produced by
	the original ATLAS system using global search. However, on x86 architectures,
	the gap in performance was substantial, and could not be bridged
	by local search alone. We argue that the problem is that the model
	assumed aggressive operation scheduling to mask instruction latencies,
	but such scheduling can actually be harmful on x86 architectures,
	a somewhat surprising fact that does not appear to be known widely.
	To address this problem, we use model refinement to generate a more
	sophisticated model that, when combined with local search, enables
	the production of high-quality code on both RISC and CISC architectures.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in autonomic, self-tuning software that
	can optimize itself on new platforms, without manual intervention.
	Optimization requires detailed knowledge of the target platform such
	as the latency and throughput of instructions, the numbers of registers,
	and the organization of the memory hierarchy. An autonomic optimization
	system needs to determine such platform-specific information on its
	own. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of
	X-Ray, which is a tool that automatically measures a large number
	of such platform-specific parameters. For some of these parameters,
	we also describe novel algorithms, which are more robust than existing
	ones. X-Ray is written in C for maximum portability, and it is based
	on accurate timing of a number of carefully designed micro-benchmarks.
	A novel feature of X-Ray is that it is easily extensible because
	it provides simple infrastructure and a code generator that can be
	used to produce the large number of micro-benchmarks needed for such
	measurements. There are few existing tools that address this problem.
	Our experiments show that X-Ray produces more accurate and more complete
	results than any of them.},

  abstract = {On modern computers, the running time of many applications is dominated
	by the cost of memory operations. To optimize such applications for
	a given platform, it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of
	the memory hierarchy parameters of that platform. In practice, this
	information is usually poorly documented if at all. Moreover, there
	is growing interest in self-tuning, autonomic software systems that
	can optimize themselves for different platforms, and these systems
	must determine memory hierarchy parameters automatically without
	human intervention. One solution is to use micro-benchmarks to determine
	the parameters of the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we argue that
	existing micro-benchmarks are inadequate, and present novel micro-benchmarks
	for determining the parameters of all levels of the memory hierarchy,
	including registers, all caches levels and the translation look-aside
	buffer. We have implemented these micro-benchmarks into an integrated
	tool that can be ported with little effort to new platforms. We present
	experimental results that show that this tool successfully determines

  year = {2005},
  abstract = {Embedded processor designs are increasingly based on general-purpose
	processor families, modified and extended in various ways. However,
	the production of software for embedded processors remains a challenging
	problem. One promising approach for addressing this problem is self-optimizing
	software: instead of writing a program, one implements a program
	generator that produces a large number of program variants, and then
	determines empirically which variant performs best. The particular
	aspect of performance that is optimized can be execution time, power
	consumption, throughout, etc. To prevent a combinatorial explosion
	in the number of program variants that have to be considered, self-optimizing
	systems bound the search space by exploiting knowledge of hardware
	parameters such as the number of registers, the capacity of the L1
	cache, etc. For software to be truly self-optimizing, hardware parameter
	values relevant for software optimization must be determined automatically.
	This paper makes the following contributions. - We describe X-Ray
	- a robust and extensible micro-benchmark framework for measuring
	hardware parameters, in which it is very easy to implement new micro-benchmarks.
	This is particularly important in the embedded processor context
	because designers constantly add new features to architectures. -
	We describe novel algorithms for measuring commonly used hardware
	parameters and show how they can be implemented in this framework.
	We evaluate our implementation experimentally on both embedded and
	desktop architectures, and show that it produces more accurate and
	complete results than existing tools.},
