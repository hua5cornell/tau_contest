\section{Conclusions}
In this contest, we explored existing efficient buffer insertion and gate sizing algorithms in the literature to fix timing violations of a design and optimize its leakage power, performance and area. We incorporated the idea presented in C-Tree Algorithm~\cite{Alpert:Buffered} and van Ginneken's algorithm~\cite{Lukas:Buffer} to implement buffer insertion for those high fan-out nets, and finally perform the gate sizing to the design based on ~\cite{Held:Gate} to conclude our optimizations. By using Galois framework for parallelization, or optimization flow is effective and efficient.
