\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this contest, we explore existing efficient buffer insertion and gate sizing algorithms in the literature to fix timing violations; and optimize area, leakage power, and clock period for a design without changing its functionality. We prototype a design optimizer, ParallelClosure, by incorporating the idea presented in~\cite{Shenoy:Minimum} to insert buffers for fixing hold time violations; and by generalizing the gate sizing by slew targeting~\cite{Held:Gate} to optimize for area and leakage power while not introducing setup or hold time violations. We analyzed the parallelism available in STA and gate sizing by slew targeting, and used the Galois framework to parallelize them in ParallelClosure. ParallelClosure is efficient and effective for designs with a reasonable number of timing violations.
